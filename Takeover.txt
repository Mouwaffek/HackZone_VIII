when we intercept the request the request of 
`http://20yjtzrx50hpypicbajmro9dy.ctf.p0wnhub.com:8888/`
to see where we are redirecting then we got the firebase link related to HZVII
`hzviii.firebaseio.com`
and when we search on internet we can get some information about misconfiguration in firebases
which appears in .json so we proceed the request

`hzviii.firebaseio.com/.json`

And Bingo we get the Flag:

`{"flag":"HZVIII{f1r3b453_d474b453_m15c0nf16ur4710n}"}`
